      "content": "# Law is Code\n\nWhen we sign a contract, we are executing a script that defines future states of relationship. Just like bad code throws errors, bad contracts create liabilities.\n\n## 1. Indemnification: The 'Catch-All' Exception\n\nThis is the `try...catch` block of legal liability. If you agree to indemnify a client, you are essentially saying: *\"If this code crashes the server (lawsuit happens), I will pay for the damages.\"*\n\n### The Fix\n\nALWAYS limit indemnification to your own *gross negligence* or *willful misconduct*. Never indemnify for third-party claims arising from the client's use of your work.\n\n## 2. IP Assignment: Who Owns the Repo?\n\nMany standard contracts have a \"Work for Hire\" clause that assigns *all* IP created during the term to the client. This is like giving them your entire GitHub account, not just the repo you built for them.\n\n### The Fix\n\nSpecify that \"Background Technology\" (your pre-existing libraries/tools) remains yours, and you grant them a *license* to use it. Only the *specific deliverables* are assigned to them.\n\n## 3. Jurisdiction: The Server Location\n\nIf you live in California but agree to \"Governing Law: New York\", you are agreeing to be sued in a court 3,000 miles away. This is a latency issue that costs thousands in travel and local counsel fees.\n\n**Takeaway**: Read contracts like pull requests. Reject bad diffs.",

You are renting capabilities, not owning them.\n\n## Level 1: The Application Layer (Tenant)\n\nThis is where most bootcamps stop. You know React and CSS. You can build a beautiful frontend, but if the API shuts down, your app is a dead interface.\n\n## Level 2: The Server Layer (Homeowner)\n\nYou run a Linux VPS (Virtual Private Server). You understand Nginx, Docker, and SSH keys. You aren't afraid of the terminal.\n\n*   **Why it matters**: You can host 100 websites for $5/mo. You are not billed per 'serverless function invocation'.\n\n## Level 3: The Data Layer (Sovereign)\n\nYou own your database. You backup your data to a physical drive in your house. You are not datamined.\n\n## The Goal: Digital Permaculture\n\nWe teach engineering not just for jobs, but for *agency*. A Global Citizen Engineer should be able to spin up a communication network for their community if the main internet goes down. That requires understanding systems, not just syntax.",

      "content": "# The Hourly Trap\n\nBilling by the hour punishes efficiency. If you get better and faster, you make less money. It creates a perverse incentive to work slowly.\n\n## Value-Based Pricing\n\nInstead of asking \"How long will this take?\", ask \"What is this worth to the client?\". \n\nIf you build an automation script that saves a company $50,000 a year, and it takes you 2 hours to write, should you charge $200 (2 hours x $100)? No. You should charge $5,000 (10% of the value captured). \n\n## The Anchoring Effect\n\nWhen presenting a price, always offer options. \n\n1.  **The Anchor (High)**: \"Full Transformation\" - $15,000\n2.  **The Target (Middle)**: \"Core Solution\" - $8,000\n3.  **The Floor (Low)**: \"Minimal Viable\" - $4,000\n\nMost clients will pick the middle option. Without the high anchor, the middle option feels expensive. With it, it feels like a deal.",

Build a node that connects easily with others. \n\n*   **Standardize your inputs/outputs** (Clear pricing, clear deliverables).\n*   **Refer aggressively**: If a job isn't a fit, send it to a peer immediately.

This signals they will be high-maintenance).\n3.  **The Chaos Agent**: Emails at 11 PM on Saturday. (They lack boundaries, and will trample yours).\n\n## Scope Creep as Technical Debt\n\nAccepting a bad client is like merging bad code into your `main` branch. It introduces bugs (stress), slows down performance (distraction), and requires massive refactoring (firing them) later. \n\n**Keep your branch clean.**",

      "content": "<h1>Law is Code</h1><p>When we sign a contract, we are executing a script that defines future states of relationship. Just like bad code throws errors, bad contracts create liabilities.</p><h2>1. Indemnification: The 'Catch-All' Exception</h2><p>This is the <code>try...catch</code> block of legal liability. If you agree to indemnify a client, you are essentially saying: <em>\"If this code crashes the server (lawsuit happens), I will pay for the damages.\"</em></p><h3>The Fix</h3><p>ALWAYS limit indemnification to your own <strong>gross negligence</strong> or <strong>willful misconduct</strong>. Never indemnify for third-party claims arising from the client's use of your work.</p><h2>2. IP Assignment: Who Owns the Repo?</h2><p>Many standard contracts have a \"Work for Hire\" clause that assigns <em>all</em> IP created during the term to the client. This is like giving them your entire GitHub account, not just the repo you built for them.</p><h3>The Fix</h3><p>Specify that \"Background Technology\" (your pre-existing libraries/tools) remains yours, and you grant them a <em>license</em> to use it. Only the <em>specific deliverables</em> are assigned to them.</p><h2>3. Jurisdiction: The Server Location</h2><p>If you live in California but agree to \"Governing Law: New York\", you are agreeing to be sued in a court 3,000 miles away. This is a latency issue that costs thousands in travel and local counsel fees.</p><blockquote><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Read contracts like pull requests. Reject bad diffs.</blockquote>",

      "content": "# Understanding Contract Language\n\nContracts are not magic spells; they are just agreements written in a specific, often exclusionary, dialect of English. The purpose of this dialect is often to obscure the balance of power.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### 1. Indemnification\nIndemnification is a promise to pay for someone else's loss. If you agree to 'indemnify and hold harmless' your client for any claims arising from your work, you are effectively acting as their insurance company.\n**Action:** Always limit indemnification to your own negligence. Never indemnify for third-party claims.\n\n### 2. Intellectual Property (IP)\nWho owns the work? In the US, if you are a contractor, you own the copyright unless you explicitly assign it in writing. This is your leverage.\n**Action:** Use an 'IP Transfer upon Full Payment' clause. They don't get the rights until the check clears.\n\n### 3. Scope Creep\nThe contract should define the 'Scope of Work' rigidly. Anything outside that box is a 'Change Order' and costs extra.\n**Action:** define what you are *not* doing as clearly as what you *are* doing.",

Many start with Squarespace or Wix, which are fine tools, but they are 'rented land'. You don't own the platform, and you are subject to their price hikes and terms of service.\n\n## The Pathway\n\n1.  **Static HTML/CSS**: Write a simple `index.html` file. Host it on GitHub Pages or Netlify. Total cost: $0.\n2.  **Static Site Generators**: Use tools like Jekyll or Hugo to manage content without a database.\n3.  **Self-Hosting**: Buy a Raspberry Pi or use a cheap VPS ($5/mo) to host your own server. \n\nBy moving down this stack, you gain control.
